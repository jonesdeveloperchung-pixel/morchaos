- ✅ **README.md** - Complete documentation with usage examples
- ✅ **.gitignore** - Python project gitignore
- ✅ **.github/workflows/ci.yml** - CI/CD pipeline for multiple OS/Python versions

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. File Deduplication
- SHA-256 hashing with chunked reading for memory efficiency
- Support for file extension filtering and directory exclusion
- Actions: list, delete, or move duplicates
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Image Duplicate Detection
- Perceptual hashing using `imagehash` library
- Configurable similarity threshold (Hamming distance)
- Support for multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, TIFF)
- Memory-efficient processing

### 3. Source Code Deduplication
- Whitespace normalization and comment removal
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Language-specific comment handling (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, etc.)
- Normalized MD5 hashing for comparison

### 4. Ebook Catalogization
- Metadata extraction from PDF, EPUB, DOCX, and MOBI files
- Author-based directory organization
- Filename fallback for metadata extraction
- Dry-run and preview modes

### 5. Chatbot Interface
- HTTP client for local Ollama endpoints
- Support for streaming and non-streaming responses
- Interactive chat mode
- Health checks and model listing
- Configurable timeouts and error handling

### 6. System Information
- Comprehensive system monitoring using `psutil`
- CPU, memory, disk, battery, and network information
- Human-readable and JSON output formats
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install the package
pip install .

# Find duplicate files
duplicate --directory /path/to/files

# Find similar images
image-diff --directory /path/to/images

# Organize ebooks by author
ebook-catalog --directory /path/to/ebooks

# Chat with local AI model
chatbot --interactive

# Get system information
system-info
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install with Poetry
poetry install

# Run tests
pytest --cov=morchaos

# Type checking
mypy morchaos

# Build package
poetry build
```

## 🧪 Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests with:
- Unit tests for all core modules
- Mocked external dependencies (requests, psutil)
- Fixtures for temporary file systems
- Coverage reporting
- CI/CD pipeline testing on Windows, macOS, and Linux
