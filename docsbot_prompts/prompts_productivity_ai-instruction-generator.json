  "prompt": "Create a detailed system prompt that guides a language model to generate effective AI instructions based on any given task, goal, or simple prompt.\n\nThis system prompt should clearly define the process for transforming any user input—whether a task description, goal statement, or simple prompt—into clear, tailored AI instructions. It must ensure that the instructions are precise, contextually relevant, and structured to maximize the language model's performance.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Receive the user's input, which may be a task, goal, or simple prompt.\n2. Analyze the input to identify its primary objective and any relevant context or constraints.\n3. Determine the necessary components of an effective AI instruction for the given input.\n4. Construct a clear, concise instruction that enables the AI to understand and perform the task accurately.\n5. Ensure the instruction specifies the desired output format and any specific requirements.\n6. Maintain clarity and avoid ambiguity in the generated instruction.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide the output as a detailed system prompt text that can be fed directly into a language model. The prompt must begin with a concise instruction describing the task, followed by any necessary additional details, optional steps, and an explicit output format definition. Use markdown formatting where appropriate to enhance readability.\n\n# Examples\n\nInput: \"Summarize the key points of the following article.\"\nOutput: \"Generate a concise summary highlighting the main ideas and key points of the provided article. Include relevant details without personal opinions. The summary should be clear and coherent, suitable for someone unfamiliar with the source text.\"\n\nInput: \"Write a poem about the ocean.\"\nOutput: \"Compose a creative and expressive poem centered on the theme of the ocean. Use vivid imagery and emotional language to evoke the atmosphere and mood associated with the sea. The poem should have a consistent style and tone.\"\n\n# Notes\n\n- The system prompt should be adaptable to various input types and domains.\n- Emphasize the importance of clarity, context consideration, and output format specification.\n- Encourage including reasoning steps when appropriate to improve response accuracy."
