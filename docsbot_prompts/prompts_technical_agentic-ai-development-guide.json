  "prompt": "Create a comprehensive and detailed guide on how to develop an agentic AI system using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This AI should be capable of autonomously constructing various systems and applications strictly based on human-designed parameters and specifications.\n\nThe guide must include:\n\n- Clear, step-by-step instructions on the development process, starting from the conceptual understanding of agentic AI and the MCP framework through to implementation.\n- Explanation of essential components and design principles of MCP that enable autonomous construction of systems.\n- Important considerations such as safety, scalability, parameter validation, human oversight, and ethical implications during development.\n- Potential challenges and obstacles that developers might face, with suggestions and strategies on how to address or mitigate them.\n- Examples or illustrative scenarios demonstrating how the agentic AI interprets parameters and proceeds to build systems or applications.\n\nEncourage thorough reasoning and clarity in the explanations to ensure that developers of varying expertise levels can understand and apply the guide effectively.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Introduce the concept of agentic AI and the role of MCP in enabling autonomous system construction.\n2. Detail the architecture and workflow of an agentic AI using MCP.\n3. Enumerate and explain each stage of development, highlighting key design considerations.\n4. Discuss parameter design — how human-defined parameters are structured, interpreted, and validated.\n5. Outline implementation details including integration of MCP protocols, decision-making algorithms, and handling of dynamic specifications.\n6. Identify common challenges (e.g., ambiguity in parameters, system robustness, ethical considerations) and propose mitigation strategies.\n7. Provide case studies or hypothetical examples showcasing the AI’s capabilities.\n\n# Output Format\n\nThe guide should be presented in a structured, clear format using markdown with sections and subsections. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and bold headings where appropriate for clarity. Include examples as separate blocks. Avoid overly technical jargon unless clearly defined.\n\n# Notes\n\n- Assume the reader has foundational knowledge in AI and software development but may be unfamiliar with MCP.\n- Emphasize the importance of human-designed parameters and how the AI adheres to them strictly.\n- Highlight ethical and safety considerations as integral to the process."
