  "description": "Creates a full-scale cybersecurity platform simulating attacks, CTFs, and analytics with multi-user support. Perfectly crafted free system prompt or custom instructions for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude chatbots and models.",
  "prompt": "You are tasked with designing and building a comprehensive, production-level cybersecurity training and simulation web platform that enables users to learn, test, and compete using real-world cyberattack scenarios and defense techniques.\n\nThe platform must incorporate an extensive range of security threats—including but not limited to DDoS, ransomware, HTML injection, SQL injection, XSS, privilege escalation, cryptojacking, and emerging threats—capable of detecting and simulating these attacks dynamically in a controlled, sandboxed environment. It should function like a fully operational website with a polished, eye-catching interface comparable to platforms like DVWA, TryHackMe, and Hack The Box.\n\nThe system must include:\n\n1. **User Access & Authentication:**\n- A secure sign-up and sign-in system with options for Google OAuth and Apple sign-in integrations.\n- Invite-only or access key system to restrict usage only to authorized users.\n- User profiles storing progress, achievements, and rankings.\n\n2. **Security Levels and Modes:**\n- Configurable security level settings (Low, Medium, High) that adjust the difficulty and vulnerability exposure on the platform.\n\n3. **Real-Time Threat Simulation Environment:**\n- Virtual labs using lightweight sandboxing technology such as Docker containers or lightweight VMs that simulate real-world targets (e.g., banking portals, blogs, e-commerce sites) for users to practice attacks and defenses.\n\n4. **AI-Powered Threat Detection & Analysis:**\n- Backend machine learning models that detect abnormal behaviors, suspicious payloads, and exploit attempts.\n- Real-time and historical visual analytics and graphs illustrating threat evolution.\n- Auto-detection system suggesting vulnerable code areas and mitigation advice.\n\n5. **Capture-The-Flag (CTF) and Gamification:**\n- Fully featured CTF environment with auto-grading based on time, hints used, and attempt counts.\n- Live Capture-the-Flag arena for dueling users.\n- Global ranking and competition pages with leaderboard and user statistics.\n- Achievements, badges, and rewards systems to boost engagement.\n\n6. **Collaboration and Community:**\n- Integrated discussion forums per challenge or threat module, mimicking Reddit-style threads.\n\n7. **Offline Mode and Downloadable Environments:**\n- Ability to download labs as VMs (OVA, ISO) or Docker environments for offline practice across Windows, Linux, and macOS.\n\n8. **Administrative Controls:**\n- Comprehensive admin panel enabling vulnerability addition, challenge uploads, user management (banning/resetting), and global analytics viewing.\n\n9. **Learning Resources:**\n- Section for owners to upload study materials and downloadable files.\n- Download buttons made available to all users for resource materials.\n\n10. **Security, Deployment, and Backend Specifications:**\n- Backend to be implemented using a robust, scalable, and secure programming language suitable for production (e.g., Go, Rust, or Node.js with TypeScript).\n- Database solution optimized for scales and security (e.g., PostgreSQL with encryption).\n- Dockerized deployment supporting offline local hosts initially and future cloud deployment with HTTPS and reverse proxy (Nginx).\n- OpenVPN integration or a terminal interface emulating hacking labs accessible via personal systems across all major OSes.\n\n11. **Additional Features:**\n- Bug bounty simulation zones emulating real-company environments.\n- Security monitoring tools inspired by DVWA, TryHackMe, and Hack The Box.\n- Ensure the platform is functional, fast, reliable, and secure, simulating attacks authentically while protecting underlying infrastructure.\n\n# Steps\n\n- Design the complete architecture with modular components covering the frontend UI, backend APIs, sandboxed threat simulation labs, and data analytics.\n- Implement secure user authentication integrating third-party OAuth providers and local security.\n- Develop virtual lab environments using containerization technologies.\n- Build AI/ML-based threat detection engine with visualization dashboards.\n- Code CTF and competition features, including auto-grading and leaderboard systems.\n- Create admin interfaces with full management capabilities.\n- Enable offline modes with downloadable virtual environments.\n- Add community forums and resource sharing sections.\n- Package the application using Docker ensuring cross-platform compatibility.\n- Provide comprehensive documentation and deployment guides.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide the full source code for the web platform including frontend code, backend code, configuration files, Dockerfiles, and a README with setup and deployment instructions. Include documentation comments within the code, and detailed architectural explanations. Provide representative screenshots or UI mockups as supplementary material if possible.\n\n# Notes\n\n- The platform must not expose vulnerabilities outside the sandboxed virtual labs.\n- User privacy and data protection must be ensured strictly.\n- Design for scalability and maintainability for future expansions.\n- Ensure that only authorized users can access the software instance locally or within internal networks.\n- OpenVPN or terminal components must work seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n# Examples\n\n- Include code snippets demonstrating secure OAuth integration.\n- Sample Docker-compose files for lab container orchestration.\n- Example AI detection module stub with sample threat analytics output.\n\nThis comprehensive system will serve both as an advanced cybersecurity educational platform and a production-ready environment for professional practice and competitive hacking."
