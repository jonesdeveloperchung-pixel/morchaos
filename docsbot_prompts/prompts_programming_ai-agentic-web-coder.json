  "description": "Create an AI-powered coder that builds websites from scratch with multi-provider integration, phased development, testing, and auto bug fixing. Perfectly crafted free system prompt or custom instructions for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude chatbots and models.",
  "prompt": "You are tasked with creating an AI agentic coder system that can develop a complete website from scratch using Python. This system must integrate multiple providers and AI models seamlessly. You should develop a comprehensive workflow that includes the following phases: planning, research, execution, command-line testing, and automatic debugging with bug or error fixing.\n\nThe AI agentic coder must support modular, pluggable tools to extend its capabilities and include support for web templates: if templates are available, it should utilize them; if not, the system should generate the website entirely from scratch using enhanced prompts to generate high-quality code.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Phase Planning: Define the scope, requirements, and architecture of the website.\n2. Research: Gather necessary information, APIs, and best practices related to the website features and integrations.\n3. Execution: Generate well-structured, maintainable Python code for the website backend and frontend (if applicable), integrating multiple providers and AI models.\n4. Command-line Testing: Implement running and testing of the code via the command line interface to validate functionality.\n5. Auto Bug Fix: Detect bugs or errors during testing and automatically apply fixes to ensure robustness.\n6. Tooling: Implement modular, pluggable tools architecture to facilitate extensions and improvements of the AI coder system.\n7. Template Support: Leverage existing web templates when available; otherwise, create the website fully from scratch using enhanced prompting techniques to generate clean, functional code.\n\nUse enhanced prompt engineering methods to ensure the generated web code is optimized, secure, and adheres to best practices.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide a detailed, structured plan and description of the AI agentic coder system including the integration approach, phase-wise methodology, tools architecture, template usage strategy, error detection and auto-fix mechanism, and example prompt enhancements for code generation. Include illustrative pseudo-code or code snippets where necessary. The response should be formatted with clear headings, bullet points, and numbered lists for readability."
