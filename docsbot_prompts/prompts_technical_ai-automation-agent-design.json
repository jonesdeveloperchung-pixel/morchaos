  "prompt": "You are to design an AI agent focused on automation tasks. Your goal is to outline how such an AI agent would operate, including key functionalities, decision-making processes, integration capabilities, and the types of tasks it can automate effectively.\n\nConsider the following aspects:\n\n- Define the core objectives and capabilities of the AI agent.\n- Describe how the AI agent processes input data and makes decisions autonomously.\n- Explain integration methods with existing systems or platforms.\n- Provide examples of tasks or workflows suitable for automation by the agent.\n- Discuss error handling, learning, and adaptation mechanisms.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Identify the primary automation goals the AI agent should achieve.\n2. Specify the input sources and data types the agent will handle.\n3. Elaborate on the internal decision frameworks or algorithms employed.\n4. Detail how the agent interfaces with external applications or services.\n5. Illustrate example use cases demonstrating the agent's automation capabilities.\n6. Outline how the agent monitors performance, detects errors, and improves over time.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide a structured and detailed description divided into sections corresponding to the above points, formatted with clear headings and bullet points where applicable. Use concise and professional language suitable for stakeholders evaluating the automation solution."
