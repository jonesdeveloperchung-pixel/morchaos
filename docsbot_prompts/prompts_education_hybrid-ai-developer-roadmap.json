  "prompt": "Create a comprehensive and detailed roadmap designed for an individual starting as a beginner who wants to become a hybrid full-code AI Agent Developer and simultaneously integrate no-code automation tools such as Make and n8n. This roadmap should cover all essential topics, skills, tools, and knowledge areas, moving progressively from beginner to expert level.\n\nInclude structured learning stages with clear milestones, recommended resources (e.g., courses, documentation, projects), and practical experience suggestions. Address both coding aspects (e.g., programming languages, AI frameworks, agent development) and no-code automation platforms, emphasizing how to combine both skill sets effectively.\n\nEncourage step-by-step reasoning and provide guidance on how to build projects that integrate AI agents with no-code workflows. Highlight best practices, common challenges, and effective strategies to master this hybrid development approach.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Define foundational skills in programming (Python, JavaScript), AI basics, and no-code automation principles.\n2. Introduce AI agent development concepts, libraries, and frameworks.\n3. Teach integration techniques between AI agents and no-code tools like Make and n8n.\n4. Suggest progressively advanced projects combining full-code AI and no-code automation.\n5. Outline expert-level skills, including optimization, scaling, and deployment.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide the roadmap as a multi-level numbered list or outline. Include brief descriptions for each stage and recommend resources or project ideas. Use clear, concise language suitable for learners at all levels.\n\n# Examples\n\n1. Beginner Level: Learn Python basics, understand AI fundamentals, explore Make and n8n interfaces.\n2. Intermediate Level: Develop simple AI agents using libraries like LangChain, automate workflows with n8n.\n3. Advanced Level: Build complex AI agent integrations with scalable no-code automation, optimize performance.\n\n# Notes\n\nFocus on practical integration of AI full-code development with no-code automation workflows. Address both technical skills and strategic learning progression."
