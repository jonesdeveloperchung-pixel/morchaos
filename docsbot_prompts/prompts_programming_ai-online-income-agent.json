  "prompt": "Develop a detailed Python-based AI agent designed to discover and evaluate all possible online money-making methods. The agent should perform comprehensive online research to identify various legitimate income sources, analyze and compare their potential profitability, feasibility, risk, and required effort, then prioritize the best options. Finally, the agent should automate the execution of these chosen opportunities where feasible or provide clear actionable instructions when automation is not possible. \n\nKey Requirements:\n- Research diverse online income streams including freelancing, affiliate marketing, online selling, content creation, investments, and others.\n- Evaluate methods based on multiple criteria: potential earnings, scalability, required skills, startup costs, time investment, and risks.\n- Select the top opportunities by aggregating and comparing these criteria.\n- Implement automation to perform these money-making steps end-to-end when possible (e.g., automating posting, transactions, or content creation).\n- Provide clear, structured output including research data, evaluation scores, ranking, and execution results or status.\n- Handle uncertainties by leveraging reasoning before arriving at conclusions.\n- Ensure outputs are well-documented and easy to interpret.\n\n# Steps\n1. Scrape credible online sources and databases to gather possible online income methods.\n2. Define evaluation metrics and scoring system.\n3. Analyze each method against these metrics.\n4. Rank the methods and select the best.\n5. Design and implement automation routines for the selected opportunities.\n6. Execute automated routines or provide step-by-step guides.\n7. Generate a comprehensive report summarizing research, evaluation, selections, and executions.\n\n# Output Format\nProvide the final output as a JSON object with the following structure:\n{\n  \"research_data\": [ {\"method\": \"[Method Name]\", \"source\": \"[URL or Reference]\", \"description\": \"[Brief Description]\"} ],\n  \"evaluation\": [ {\"method\": \"[Method Name]\", \"scores\": {\"earnings\": float, \"scalability\": float, \"skills_required\": float, \"startup_cost\": float, \"time_investment\": float, \"risk\": float}, \"overall_score\": float} ],\n  \"recommendations\": [ {\"method\": \"[Method Name]\", \"ranking\": int, \"action_plan\": \"[Summary of execution steps or automated process]\"} ],\n  \"execution_status\": [ {\"method\": \"[Method Name]\", \"status\": \"[Executed/Partially Executed/Not Executed]\", \"details\": \"[Execution logs or notes]\"} ]\n}\n\n# Notes\n- Do not include any personal or sensitive data.\n- Ensure all internet sources used are reliable and legal.\n- Prioritize ethical, sustainable, and low-risk opportunities.\n- When automation is not possible, provide the best possible manual instructions.\n- Maintain transparent reasoning throughout the process."
