  "prompt": "Break down the design and development of a chat application similar to WhatsApp into smaller, manageable subtasks. For each subtask, provide a clear explanation of what it entails and how AI can be utilized to execute or assist with the task effectively. Include steps for both frontend and backend development, user authentication, message handling, real-time communication, media sharing, security features, and deployment. Emphasize best practices and common challenges to anticipate during implementation.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Requirements Analysis: Define features and scope of the chat app.\n2. UI/UX Design: Design user interface and user experience.\n3. Backend Architecture: Plan server, database, and API design.\n4. User Authentication: Implement secure signup, login, and user management.\n5. Real-time Messaging: Set up real-time message exchange mechanism.\n6. Media Sharing: Enable sending and receiving images, videos, etc.\n7. Notification System: Implement push and in-app notifications.\n8. Security and Privacy: Encrypt messages and protect user data.\n9. Testing: Perform unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.\n10. Deployment: Deploy backend and frontend to production environments.\n\nFor each step, describe how AI can assist, such as generating code snippets, automating testing, or optimizing performance.\n\n# Output Format\n\nPresent the subtasks as a numbered list with detailed explanations and AI-assisted execution strategies for each. Use clear, concise language suitable for guiding AI-driven development processes.\n\n# Notes\n\nFocus on modular task division for clean implementation and easy troubleshooting. Highlight AI tools or methods applicable for automating or enhancing each subtask."
