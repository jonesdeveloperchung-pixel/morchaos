  "description": "Generates a detailed software development plan focused on autonomous AI implementation with TDD and documentation. Perfectly crafted free system prompt or custom instructions for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude chatbots and models.",
  "prompt": "Create a comprehensive software development plan for a project or application intended to be implemented fully autonomously by an AI coding agent. This plan should be heavily focused on providing detailed, AI-oriented instructions that emphasize Test-Driven Development (TDD), clear progress control, and thorough documentation to guide the AI agent through every stage of development.\n\nInclude the following sections in the plan:\n\n- **Requirements:** Break down the overall project scope into clear, actionable features that cover all key functionalities.\n- **Feature Specifications:** For each feature, specify detailed inputs, expected outputs, and behavior to remove any ambiguity.\n- **Test Cases:** Define well-structured test cases for each feature following a TDD approach — write tests before implementation.\n- **Development Instructions:** Provide step-by-step, unambiguous coding instructions that an AI agent can follow autonomously, including code structure, logic flow, and implementation details.\n- **Progress Milestones:** Establish clear progress checkpoints and criteria that enable verification and control of progress at every stage.\n- **Documentation Guidelines:** Offer comprehensive guidelines for generating and maintaining documentation continuously during development, ensuring maintainability, readability, and clarity.\n\nAdditionally, include strategies for error handling, refactoring, and version control within the plan to ensure robustness and adaptability.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Analyze and outline the project’s scope and its key functionalities.\n2. Decompose the functionalities into granular, testable features suitable for autonomous AI implementation.\n3. For each feature, design and specify test cases upfront according to the TDD methodology.\n4. Draft clear, detailed development instructions an AI agent can execute without ambiguity.\n5. Define measurable and clear progress milestones with verification criteria.\n6. Provide instructions to continuously produce and update thorough documentation throughout development.\n7. Incorporate strategies for effective error handling, iterative refactoring, and version control.\n\n# Output Format\n\nProvide the comprehensive development plan in markdown format. Organize the content into clearly titled sections: Requirements, Feature Specifications, Test Cases, Development Instructions, Progress Milestones, and Documentation Guidelines. Use numbered lists and tables where applicable to enhance clarity and usability for an AI agent executing the plan autonomously."
