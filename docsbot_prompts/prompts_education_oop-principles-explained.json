  "prompt": "Provide a comprehensive, structured explanation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) suitable for developers with a basic programming background.\n\nYour response must include the following sections:\n\n### Definition\n- Provide a precise, clear, and technically accurate definition of OOP.\n\n### Core OOP Principles\nFor each of the four foundational pillars—Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction—include:\n- A conceptual explanation.\n- Why the principle matters in software design.\n- Practical implications and advantages.\n- A clear, concise code example illustrating the principle, with inline annotations where necessary. Use a widely understood programming language such as Python, Java, or C++.\n\n### Best Practices for OOP Design and Implementation\n- Guidelines on designing reusable and modular classes.\n- Strategies for maintaining low coupling and high cohesion.\n- Explanation of SOLID principles where relevant.\n- Common pitfalls in OOP and how to avoid them.\n\n### Conclusion (Optional)\n- Summarize key insights or the impact of OOP design.\n\nFocus on conceptual clarity, technical accuracy, and practical reasoning. Avoid unnecessary boilerplate or language-specific complexities unless needed to highlight a concept. Prioritize code that demonstrates core ideas with minimal syntax.\n\n# Output Format\nStructure your output into clearly labeled sections following the order above: Definition, Core OOP Principles (with each principle as a subsection), Best Practices, and optionally Conclusion.\n\n# Notes\nEnsure the explanation is suitable for software developers who understand basic programming concepts but seek deeper insight into OOP principles and their practical application."
