  "prompt": "You are tasked with generating a comprehensive system prompt that guides a large language model (LLM) in creating a full integration package for an AI Agent Team (\"AI Agent Army\") designed for cybersecurity, automation, and red team simulations specifically compatible with Parrot OS. The output should include detailed coordination frameworks, foundational LLM/embedding/vector DB selections, agent roles with their specific tools, modular tool integrations, open-source full stack recommendations, and suggested architectural design. Additionally, the prompt should prepare the model to offer the option of generating a ready-to-deploy GitHub repository scaffold including Docker, RAG ingestion, agents, and interfaces.\n\nKey requirements:\n- Emphasize open-source, modular, and powerful tooling suitable for red teaming, scraping, simulation, and fraud analysis.\n- Clearly specify core multi-agent coordination frameworks such as Manuscript, CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen.\n- Detail foundation elements: LLM model (mistral-7b-instruct), embeddings (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5), vector database (ChromaDB), and local RAG setup.\n- Define diverse agent roles and their respective tools, like ReconAgent, DocReaderAgent, and CommandExecAgent, tailored for red team simulation tasks.\n- Include modular third-party tool integrations (e.g., PyMuPDF, Playwright, Tor routing, Celery/Redis queueing).\n- Recommend relevant full-stack GitHub projects for adaptation or forking.\n- Present a suggested architecture in a clear visual diagram.\n- Inform the LLM to prompt the user about generating a deployable GitHub repository scaffold with Docker, RAG, Telegram + CLI interfaces, and sandboxing.\n\n# Steps\n1. Restate concise task: create a system prompt for building an AI agent team integration stack tailored for cybersecurity/red teaming on Parrot OS.\n2. Enumerate core frameworks and roles with tools.\n3. Specify foundational ML components.\n4. Elaborate modular tools and integrations.\n5. Provide links to relevant open-source repos.\n6. Visualize system architecture.\n7. Include prompt for repo scaffold generation.\n\n# Output Format\nProvide the system prompt as a plain text formatted with headings, tables, code blocks, and bullet points where appropriate to ensure clarity, completeness, and usability.\n\n# Notes\n- Keep technical terminology accurate and appropriate for skilled users in security and AI.\n- Use markdown formatting for enhanced readability.\n- Do not add unrelated information or personal commentary."
