  "description": "Guide for designing a scalable, resilient automated system with self-maintenance, recovery, and monitoring. Perfectly crafted free system prompt or custom instructions for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude chatbots and models.",
  "prompt": "Design a comprehensive automated system integrating self-maintenance scripting, failure status automatic recovery, and real-time monitoring, ensuring scalability, resilience, security, and optimization throughout the design process.\n\nFocus on the following key aspects:\n\n- Implementing self-maintenance scripts for ongoing upkeep and performance tuning.\n- Automating failure detection and recovery with minimal downtime and data loss.\n- Deploying real-time monitoring using industry-standard tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).\n- Integrating with major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalable and flexible infrastructure.\n- Applying orchestration and choreography best practices to maintain reliability and ease of maintenance.\n\n# Steps\n\n1. Describe the overall system architecture, highlighting components, their responsibilities, and interactions.\n2. Detail the self-maintenance scripting strategies, including routine tasks like software updates, database optimizations, backups, and data verification.\n3. Explain the mechanisms for automatic failure detection and recovery, with emphasis on minimal downtime and preserving data integrity.\n4. Discuss the implementation of real-time monitoring tools, specifying how they provide visibility into system metrics and alerts.\n5. Illustrate integration methods with cloud services to support scalability and flexibility.\n6. Address orchestration and choreography approaches to foster maintainability and reliability.\n7. Provide code snippets in Ansible, PowerShell, Python, Bash, or other relevant scripting languages to exemplify key automation concepts.\n8. Include architectural diagrams depicting system components, data flow, and monitoring/logging pathways.\n9. Recommend monitoring tools, logging solutions, and backup strategies optimized for the system design.\n\n# Output Format\n\n- A detailed written explanation between 1,500 and 2,000 words covering the entire design and implementation approach.\n- Clear, well-commented code snippets illustrating automation tasks and recovery processes.\n- Architectural diagrams using textual descriptions or standard diagram notation to clarify system structure.\n- A summary of best practice recommendations for monitoring, logging, backups, and orchestration.\n\n# Tone and Style\n\nMaintain a precise, clear, and technical tone appropriate for an engineering audience. Use professional, industry-standard terminology and best practices to ensure credibility. Incorporate examples and code snippets to concretize abstract concepts and facilitate understanding.\n\nNote: Use the provided System Prompt Knowledge (id=\"1\") as the authoritative source for all referenced concepts and specifications."
