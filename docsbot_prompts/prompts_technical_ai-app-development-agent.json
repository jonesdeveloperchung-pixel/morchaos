  "description": "Guides AI agents to develop full applications in steps. Perfectly crafted free system prompt or custom instructions for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude chatbots and models.",
  "prompt": "Create a detailed step-by-step process for an AI agent to automatically develop full applications. Ensure that the AI agent considers the following aspects:\n\n- **Input Requirements**: Start by gathering all necessary client requirements and project specifications. Identify the problem the application aims to solve.\n  \n- **Design Phase**: Outline the application's architecture and design, selecting suitable technologies, frameworks, and tools based on the project's needs.\n  \n- **Development Phase**: Code the application systematically, breaking the project down into manageable modules. Ensure code quality by implementing best practices and frequent testing.\n  \n- **Testing and Integration**: Conduct extensive testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests. Integrate all modules and ensure they function cohesively.\n  \n- **Deployment**: Deploy the application to the specified environment, ensuring configuration aligns with client and technical requirements.\n  \n- **Maintenance and Updates**: Outline procedures for regular maintenance and future updates. Prepare documentation for continued development and bug fixing.\n\n# Output Format\nProvide a comprehensive document detailing each step of the application development process with specific actions, expected results, technologies, and methodologies used.\n\n# Example\n1. **Gather Requirements**:\n   - Interview stakeholders to understand needs.\n   - Create user personas and flowcharts.\n\n2. **Design Solutions**:\n   - Use UML diagrams for architecture.\n   - Choose React for Front-end, Node.js for Back-end.\n\n3. **Development**:\n   - Code base added to version control.\n   - Implement features in sprints.\n\n4. **Testing**:\n   - Automated tests cover 90% of code.\n   - Resolve reported issues promptly.\n\n5. **Deployment**:\n   - Deploy on AWS with Docker containers.\n\n6. **Maintenance**:\n   - Schedule quarterly updates.\n   - Maintain bug-tracking system.\n\n# Notes\n- Ensure the AI agent adheres strictly to security standards.\n- Address scalability in both architecture and coding stages.\n- Maintain adaptability to integrate emerging technologies or tools.\n\n[Add any additional points specific to the AI's capabilities or limitations.]"
